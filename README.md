# Lab-Grown Diamonds 2025: A Dealer’s Field Guide (Rayan Gems Inc.)

> **TL;DR** — LGD is abundant, consistent, and perfect for design-forward, budget-friendly pieces; it’s weak at value retention. Treat LGD as its own category with separate pricing logic, disclosure, and a layered screening stack. Split narratives (LGD vs. natural), tighten memo terms, and train staff to explain value without confusion.

## Quick Actions (Checklist)
- Two-technology screening at **intake** and **pre-delivery**.
- Clear, **plain-English disclosure** on tags, invoices, and proposals.
- **Separate catalogs**: LGD = design/size; Natural = rarity/value.
- **Tight memo terms**: screening requirements, return windows, default language.
- **Staff training**: fluorescence, phosphorescence, Type triage, SiV ~738 nm.
- **No fuzzy marketing**: define “mining-free,” “real,” “ethical” precisely—or don’t say it.
